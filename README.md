# Guildbook_ClassicEra
Over the course of Blizzards re-release of World of Warcraft, Guildbook went through some significant changes with each expansion.

This version of the addon has brought some of the newer code and styling back into the older game versions, intended for Classic Era, SoD and Anniversary.

The intention here is to create an addon that will work across the original 3 versions of the game, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.
